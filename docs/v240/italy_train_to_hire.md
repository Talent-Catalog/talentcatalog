## Overview
This release introduces targeted improvements to support the Italy train-to-hire program, addressing 
critical government data requirements and reducing error-prone manual processes. The updates empower 
candidates to take ownership of their information and support smoother coordination between TBB, 
UNHCR, and government agencies.

## Why This Matters
To complete a conditional job offer in Italy, refugee candidates and their relocating family members 
must submit the following to Italian authorities:

- Travel document scans
- Evidence of **Refugee Status Determination (RSD)**
- Refugee ID (if applicable)

These documents are reviewed by **three separate government agencies**, and even minor data 
inconsistencies can result in **significant delays or abandoned cases**. Until now, TBB and UNHCR have 
manually transcribed data from scanned documents into spreadsheets — a slow, error-prone process 
exacerbated by mismatches between candidate profiles and submitted documents.

This release addresses those issues by applying core **Talent Catalog principles**: data 
self-management by candidates, minimal redundant requests, and a single system of truth.
