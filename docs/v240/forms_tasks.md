## Introducing Forms Tasks: Smarter Candidate Data Collection

This release introduces a powerful new capability within the Talent Catalog: Forms Tasks — a 
flexible, scalable framework that simplifies how we collect, update, and manage candidate data.

Forms Tasks expand on the existing Tasks system by allowing multiple pieces of related information 
to be gathered in a structured form — all from within a single task. This is especially valuable in 
workflows where detailed, multi-field data is required, such as government submissions or 
multi-step candidate onboarding.

## Why Forms Tasks Matter

Until now, candidate tasks were limited to:

📎 Simple Upload Tasks (e.g., to upload a scan of a passport)

💬 Question Tasks (e.g. to submit the answer to a single question -- just one piece of data)

✅ Simple Acknowledgement Tasks (e.g., to confirm that an action has been taken)

Forms Tasks build on this capability by supporting the collection of multiple fields and different
types of information all in one go, creating much richer interactions with candidates and more 
complex workflows — all within the familiar Tasks experience.
