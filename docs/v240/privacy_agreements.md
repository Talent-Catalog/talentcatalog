## Overview
To meet the evolving legal and operational needs of the Talent Catalog, this release delivers a 
comprehensive upgrade of our data protection agreements and privacy policies, aligning them
with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — the global benchmark for data privacy.

While GDPR originates from the European Union, its standards have been widely adopted worldwide. 
GDPR compliance positions the Talent Catalog for responsible data handling across jurisdictions, 
including the UK and USA.
