## Introducing Our New UI: Cleaner, Sharper, and More Scalable
The Talent Catalog just got a major visual refresh. 🚀
Our new interface brings a fresh look and a stronger foundation for what’s coming next.
Every color, icon, and layout choice has been carefully designed for a clean, modern and harmonious 
user experience.

The Talent Catalog’s redesign isn’t just about looks — it’s about building a scalable, maintainable,
and user-centered foundation for the future.

We’re excited to hear your impressions as you explore the new interface!

## Figma and Design Process
- Explain the process (Figma, team workshopping, everything has reason behind it)
- Screenshots of the figma designs and how we were able to turn those into code

## Technical Benefits
- Technical benefits of the new UI, shared components, consistency, easier to make changes

## Feedback
- Welcome feedback, and will be gathering more for phase 2. Do we create a public slack channel for 
UI feedback? Or introduce a google survey in a couple of months?

Include before & after images of key pages to show the transformation
