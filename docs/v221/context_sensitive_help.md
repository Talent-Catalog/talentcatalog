title: Context Sensitive Help

We now have support for context-sensitive help linking directly to existing process documents. This 
help can be country specific and can be updated by TC admin users as new help documentation becomes 
available.

<div class="card-image-container">
  <img src="./../assets/images/v221/ContextHelp.png" 
        alt="Context Sensitive Help" class="card-image">
</div>

In this release we have introduced a new tab in Settings (Help Links) where you can define new 
help links, with a label and a link to your process documentation. The other fields shown are context 
fields. So for example at the Visa Eligibility job stage, context-sensitive help will be available
relevant to that stage.

In an upcoming release we will add help icons to the Talent Catalog in the appropriate places, so 
that users can click on these icons and see the context-sensitive help links right where they need
it and navigate to the shown links for help.

You're welcome to start adding your context-sensitive help links via Settings, like those already 
shown for Canada - that's where this idea came from!
