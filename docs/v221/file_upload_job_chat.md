Job chats support file uploads which are a convenient mechanism for sharing documents. For instance, 
candidates, admins, and employers can upload passport images via chat messages, with the uploaded 
file automatically saved in the candidate's Google Drive folder.

1) Click on the file upload icon here:

<div class="card-image-container">
  <img src="./../assets/images/v221/UploadFile.png" 
        alt="Upload File" class="card-image">
</div>

2) Select a file to upload (files accepted are: jpg, png, pdf, doc, docx, txt)

<div class="card-image-container">
  <img src="./../assets/images/v221/SelectFile.png" 
        alt="Select File" class="card-image">
</div>

3) File will be uploaded to the candidate's google drive (in a Chat Uploads subfolder) and a 
hyperlink to the file will display in the post as 'link to file'.

<div class="card-image-container">
  <img src="./../assets/images/v221/ClickableLink.png" 
        alt="Clickable Link" class="card-image">
</div>
