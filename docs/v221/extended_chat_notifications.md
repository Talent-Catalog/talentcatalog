Job chat notifications have been extended so that admins can quickly see if they have any unread
chats and navigate down to jobs and cases with pending unread chats.

<div class="card-image-container">
  <img src="./../assets/images/v221/Notifications.png" 
        alt="Login" class="card-image">
</div>

An asterisk in the relevant tabs indicates an unread chat. With filters to zoom in on Jobs and Cases
with unread chats.

Additionally, candidates are notified of new chats they have received in the candidate portal and 
have not yet read via email:

<div class="card-image-container">
  <img src="./../assets/images/v221/Email.png" 
        alt="Email Notification" class="card-image">
</div>
