Job chat notifications have been extended so that admins can quickly see if they have any unread
chats and navigate down to jobs and cases with pending unread chats.

<div class="card-image-container">
  <img src="./../assets/images/v221/Notifications.png" 
        alt="Login" class="card-image">
</div>

An asterisk in the relevant tabs indicates an unread chat. With filters to zoom in on Jobs and Cases
with unread chats.
