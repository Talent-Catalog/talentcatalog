# Mini Intake

## Confirm General Information

Candidate age, gender and UNRWA registration status is visible in general information. 

<div class="card-image-container">
  <img src="./../assets/images/v221/ConfirmGeneralInformation.png" 
        alt="Confirm General Information" class="card-image">
</div>

Edit contact information directly from the mini-intake tab without having to jump back to the 
general tab.

## Interest in International Recruitment

The wording of the initial question was misleading some users. It previously said "Are you interested
in international employment opportunities" but the intention for the question is to confirm a candidate's
availability rather than interest in opportunities.

been expanded to allow multiple citizenships.
