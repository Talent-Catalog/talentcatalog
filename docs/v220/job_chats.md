# Employers and Destination Partners

Destination partner, including employers such as Iress, can communicate about jobs and candidate 
cases with other interested parties such as source partners and candidates, directly 
from the Talent Catalog using Job Chats. This means that there is no need for an employer to use
Slack. Job Chats provides a standard and unified way to communicate about jobs and candidate cases.

For example, employers (and destination partners) can communicate directly with individual source 
partners regarding a job opportunity. They may also communicate in **group chats** with all source 
partners at once. For candidates and cohorts who have received and accepted job offers a special 
group chat focussed on relocation is also available for the employer and all parties, including 
candidates, to communicate.

# Source Partner Job Chats

Source partners like TBB, CRS, and others who are working individual candidate cases are able to 
send and receive communications directly from the Talent Catalog regarding a specific candidate
case. They can communicate one-to-one with the candidate, or with both the candidate and employer 
together depending on the nature and need of the communication.

# Candidate Job Chats

Candidates have always been able to see their registration profile in the Talent Catalog candidate
portal. They have tasks in the candidate portal, which we plan to use more in the future to help
scale through automation. With this update, under the new Jobs tab, candidates are now also able to
send and receive job related communications directly from the Talent Catalog.
