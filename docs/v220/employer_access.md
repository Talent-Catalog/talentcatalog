# Employer Access

This long-awaited update allows employers to be able to access the Talent Catalog directly. For
example, Iress, Atlassian or any other employer can now request a login to the Talent Catalog, 
where they can create and submit their own jobs, do their own searches for candidates, and manage 
their own recruitment process.
