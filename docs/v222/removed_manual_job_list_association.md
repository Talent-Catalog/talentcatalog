title: Remove ability to associate job with list
sass:
  style: compressed
---

The "submission list" is the main list associated with a job. It is automatically created when the job is created.
Its use is unchanged.

However, it used to be possible for a user to manually associate a job with any list - and that list would behave a bit like a submission list even though it wasn't. For example, adding a candidate to that list would automatically create a candidate opportunity. This ability to associate a job with any list wasn't widely used - but it did cause some nasty bugs with people accidentally creating or modifying candidate opportunities when they didn't mean to. So we decided it was best to remove the ability.

If you feel that you need that ability to manually associate jobs with lists, please let us know and perhaps we can find a different solution for you.
