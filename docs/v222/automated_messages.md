Following on from the Job Chats feature in an earlier release [see Job Chats release](./../v220/job_chats.md) we have 
extended this feature by releasing 'Automated Chats'. This new feature allows the TC to send out 'updates' to all 
desired parties in one automation via Job Chats. The Automated Chats can be broadcast to multiple relevant chats, 
from partners to candidates. We are introducing some standard automated posts in this release, but more can be created 
and all post copy can be edited. 
See below a summary of the automated posts introduced in the release 2.2.2, or for a more indepth look at Job Chats & 
Automated Posts see the explainer documentation 
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h5QaUNOSPP-pjJsMCDwXS_SQUrurvLfnBKPX87orgbE/edit?usp=sharing).
