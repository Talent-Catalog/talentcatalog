# Case Tracking

Within the admin portal, we have implemented functionality to allow for ease of tracking and management of candidate 
opportunities. This enhancement allows Talent Catalog administrators to easily oversee potential candidate 
opportunities (or "cases") that have been put forward for a particular job.

# Job Listings

Within the Talent Catalog candidate portal, candidates now have the capability to access and explore job listings that 
they have been selected for in line with their qualifications, experience and preferences. This enhancement enables 
candidates to easily navigate through potential employment opportunities, from the convenience of their personalised 
candidate portal

# Job Opportunity Updates

The Talent Catalog candidate portal now implements a system to keep candidates informed about the progress of jobs for 
which they have been selected. This automates and enhances communication between administrators and candidates by 
ensuring that candidates receive timely updates about crucial changes that matter to them. 

Our existing Talent Catalog administrators have thoughtfully selected the stage updates to be reported, thus providing 
candidates with notification that are both meaningful and considerate of their circumstances. We are, as always, deeply 
appreciative of the ongoing collaboration and support from all our valued users!
