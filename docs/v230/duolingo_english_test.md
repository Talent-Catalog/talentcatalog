## Duolingo English Test Integration
The Talent Catalog is happy to announce a partnership with Duolingo, allowing selected candidates to access free coupons to take the Duolingo English Test (DET). 
The DET is a modern English proficiency assessment available online, taking approximately 1 hour and results being returned in 2 days. 

Working with Duolingo's API we are able to manage the coupons and track the results directly through the Talent Catalog.
Through the Talent Catalog admin portal, admins can:

### Upload coupons provided by Duolingo to the TC
