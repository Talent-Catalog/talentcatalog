## General Improvements

- Email verification implemented for both candidate and admin users to reduce the number of bad or mistyped emails

- Capture latest tab via the URL's tab parameter allowing for direct navigation to tab and will allow heat mapping on each tab
- Selection of stats in TC Stats (max 8) allowing stats to be run on the full database without performance issues
- Removed 'Run Old Stats' button from TC Stats as has been improved with the newer 'Run Stats' button
- Tasks have rich text descriptions so that links and formatting can be added to a task description
- Added relocated address fields (address, city, state, country) to candidate. Updatable on the candidate portal once the candidate has a case that is past the job offer stage. Can be updated anytime on the admin portal.
- Relocated country auto-populates with the destination country when a candidate's case is moved to or past the relocated stage.
- When a relocated address field is updated, a candidate note is created for tracking purposes and to help indicate if a relocated address is up to date.
- Candidates are automatically informed about Pathway Club (by email) when they have accepted a job offer
- Job titles now editable by owners and System Admins after publishing
- Option to set inactive partners' referral links to redirect to a nominated replacement
- Reassign candidates to new managing partner based on saved search results
- Submission List view now optionally displays the username and partner org of admin who added each candidate

## Data Improvements

- Housekeeping undertaken to align TC data with Salesforce Employer Opportunities
- Rename tbbShortName to tcShortName
- Rename task field 'helpLink' to 'docLink' as help links can now be linked to in rich text task descriptions (see #1829). Repurposed field to docLink to be used to display documents in iframe in tasks.
- Daily scheduled methods keep TC Opportunity data aligned with changes made on Salesforce
- Candidate relocated address replicated in Salesforce, dynamically displayed only if present
