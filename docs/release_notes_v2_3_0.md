## General Improvements

- Option to 'Skip Candidate Search' on a job, this allows employers to indicate whether they want source partners to search for candidates or prefer to 'skip' and proceed only with candidates theyâ€™ve added to the submission list.
- Admins can redirect URLs pointing to inactive partners, this allows for 'hard coded' URLs (e.g QR codes/printed flyers) to inactive partners remain usable and redirect to the replacement partner.
- Candidates in saved search results can be reassigned to a new managing partner
- Capture latest tab via the URL's tab parameter allowing for direct navigation to tab and will allow heat mapping on each tab
- Selection of stats in TC Stats (max 8) allowing stats to be run on the full database without performance issues
- Removed 'Run Old Stats' button from TC Stats as has been improved with the newer 'Run Stats' button
- Tasks have rich text descriptions so that links and formatting can be added to a task description
- Added relocated address fields (address, city, state, country) to candidate. Updatable on the candidate portal once the candidate has a case that is past the job offer stage. Can be updated anytime on the admin portal.
- Relocated country auto-populates with the destination country when a candidate's case is moved to or past the relocated stage.
- When a relocated address field is updated, a candidate note is created for tracking purposes and to help indicate if a relocated address is up to date.

## Data Improvements
- Expose Country ISO codes and Occupation ISCO codes
- New icon identifying potential duplicate candidate profiles, updating daily and in real-time by the resolution modal opened when icon clicked (HOTFIX)
- Housekeeping undertaken to align TC data with Salesforce Employer Opportunities
- Rename tbbShortName to tcShortName
- Rename task field 'helpLink' to 'docLink' as help links can now be linked to in rich text task descriptions (see #1829). Repurposed field to docLink to be used to display documents in iframe in tasks.
