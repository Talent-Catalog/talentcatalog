  /**
   * Tracks page views in a Single Page Application (SPA) context using Google Analytics.
   *
   * In traditional websites, navigation between pages naturally triggers a page load,
   * which Google Analytics uses to track page views. However, in SPAs like those built with Angular,
   * navigation changes the content dynamically without reloading the entire page. This function
   * subscribes to Angular Router events to detect when navigation ends and a new "page" is viewed,
   * manually sending page view information to Google Analytics.
   *
   * The `NavigationEnd` event indicates a successful route change, at which point we use the
   * `gtag` function with the 'config' command to send the current page path to Google Analytics.
   *
   * Additionally, console logs are included for testing purposes.
   *
   * See, for example, https://blog.mestwin.net/add-google-analytics-to-angular-application-in-3-easy-steps
