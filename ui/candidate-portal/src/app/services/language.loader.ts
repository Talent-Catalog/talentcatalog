 * This is an ngx-translate custom loader. We use it to fetch translations

 * in files.tbbtalent.org/translations.
 * <p/>
 * This custom loader is configured in app.module.ts - the import of TranslateModule there.
 * <p/>
 * See also https://github.com/ngx-translate/core#write--use-your-own-loader
 * <p/>
 * Note that the normal approach is to store the json translation files in the Angular code
 * base in the assets/i18n directory of the candidate portal code.
 * See https://github.com/ngx-translate/core#configuration.
 * <p/>
 * The advantage of our approach is that admin backend users can easily change translations
 * instantly from the Settings|Translations menu without making a new system release.
