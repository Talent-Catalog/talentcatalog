</p>
<h2 id="CookieUse">How do we use cookies?</h2>
<p>
  The Talent Catalog uses cookies to improve your experience on our website, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keeping you signed in</li>
  <li>Remembering your preferences (for example, preferred language)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is the common minimal use of cookies that is essential for the basic functioning of any website.
</p>
<h2 id="CookieType">What type of cookies do we use?</h2>
<p>
  There are a number of different types of cookies, however, our website only uses
  "functional" cookies which are essential for the basic functioning of any website.
  Functional cookies help us recognize you on our website and remember your previously selected
  preferences.
</p>
<h2 id="CookieManage">How to manage your cookies</h2>
<p>
  You can set your browser not to accept cookies and your browser will also allow you to remove
  cookies.
</p>
<p>
  However, the Talent Catalog relies on its minimal use cookies for its normal operation so you
  should accept cookies. That will be the normal default setting of your browser.
  If you remove cookies you will be logged out of the Talent Catalog (and any other websites you
  may be logged into). You may also lose any preferences that you have set.
</p>
<h2 id="OtherWebsites">Privacy policies of other websites</h2>
<p>

  so if you click on a link to another website, you should read their privacy policy.
</p>
<h2 id="OtherPartners">Privacy policies of other Talent Catalog partners</h2>
<p>
  All Talent Catalog partners are required to act according to the same standard privacy
  policy. If your partner changes, you will be asked to accept a policy with that new partner -
  but it will be the same policy.
</p>
<h2 id="PolicyChange">Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
<p>
  You can view this policy at any time by logging in to your Talent Catalog account and selecting
  Privacy Policy from your account menu. You will also see your Talent Catalog partner there.
  This privacy policy is a contract between you and your Talent Catalog partner.
</p>
<p>
  Occasionally the privacy policy may change. Or you may change to a different Talent Catalog
  partner - for example, if you have moved to another country. In either case you will be
  automatically asked to consent to the latest privacy policy with your current Talent Catalog
  partner.
</p>
