    <p>Dear <span th:text="${displayName}"></span>,</p>
    <p>Thank you for registering with Talent Beyond Boundaries. </p>

    <p>Our team has reviewed your profile and determined that it is incomplete. This means your profile cannot currently be considered for international employment opportunities until you have added the missing information. Please look back through your profile and add additional information. Remember to "submit" your profile at the end.</p>

    <p th:text="${candidateMessage}"></p>

    <p>Your username is <span th:text="${username}"></span>.<br/>
        If you forget your password, you can reset it <a th:href="${forgotPwdUrl}">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Please note that having an active profile does not mean that you will be matched with a job opportunity. TBB will only contact you if an employer expresses interest in your profile.</p>

    <p>Please continue to update your profile as you gain additional experience, education, or skills. Talent Beyond Boundaries’ (TBB) mission is to open international visa pathways for refugees and other forcibly displaced people to use their skills and talents as a route towards restored self-reliance and safety. </p>

    <p>TBB is a nonprofit organization with a cooperation agreement with UNHCR. We link those who are displaced by conflict with jobs in countries around the world where their skills are needed and facilitate the visas for them to work abroad. Anyone is welcome to create a profile on the Talent Catalog; by sharing information about your employment history and skills, you contribute to demonstrating the breadth and depth of talent among displaced people. However, at this time, TBB is only considering applicants currently based in Lebanon and Jordan for positions in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. We will continue to update the Talent Catalog, our website, and our social media with any changes to our program. 
        We share frequent updates of our progress to open this new pathway to our various media channels and will also email these updates to registrants who have provided an email.  Please follow us on our various channels:</p>
