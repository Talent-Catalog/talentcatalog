Dear [(${displayName})],

Thank you for registering on the Talent Catalog
       
Your username is [(${username})].

For the best chance of attracting an employer’s attention, continue to update your profile as you gain additional experience, education, or skills.

Be assured that we will not share your contact information with any other party without your permission (see our Privacy Policy https://www.talentbeyondboundaries.org/privacy-and-data-protection-policy).
       
Talent Beyond Boundaries’ mission (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH_5_vBhiFk) is to help refugees and other forcibly displaced people find safety and security through skilled migration.
       
Please keep in mind that - while we want to help everyone - only a very small proportion of people listed in our Talent Catalog will ever be offered international employment. Thus you should not completely rely on this solution, and should continue to pursue other opportunities if/when they are available to you.
       
We will only contact you if an employer expresses interest in your profile.
       
If you manage to secure an international job offer independently of Talent Beyond Boundaries, let us know, as we may be able to assist you with your visa application.
       
In the meantime, we share frequent program updates via these channels:
