       <p>Thank you for registering with Talent Beyond Boundaries. Your username is <span th:text="${username}"></span>.<br/>

      Talent Beyond Boundaries (TBB) is a nonprofit organization working to open a new safe and legal pathway for individuals fleeing conflict to connect with international employment opportunities in countries where their skills are needed. TBB is implementing a pilot project with those who are displaced and living in Jordan and Lebanon to initially match 30 people with corporations abroad in need of their skills. While only a limited number will be matched with employment initially in order to prove this new pathway is viable, TBB encourages a large number of people who have been displaced from their home country and are living in Lebanon and Jordan to register to show employers the wide range of talent that they can consider in international hiring.  After completion of the pilot project, we plan to scale up to connect thousands of displaced people to international employment around the world.</p> 
   
      <p>At this time, our project is limited in size and thus we will only contact a small number of registrants to move forward. Talent Beyond Boundaries cannot guarantee employment for any registrants. We will continue to contact registrants throughout 2017. If you are not among the small group of registrants contacted during the pilot project in 2017, your profile will remain in the Talent Catalog to be considered for future opportunities. Please be sure to complete your profile since profiles less than 70% complete might be deleted after six months of inactivity.  In order to be considered for international employment, users must fill in a complete profile. Incomplete profiles will not be considered by employers due to the lack of information provided. It is critical that you provide at least one form of contact and we encourage you to update your contact information if it changes.</p>
   
      <p>Please understand that TBB is undertaking an initiative that has not previously been done by other organizations. This new safe and legal pathway takes time to develop and we appreciate your participation and patience as we work together on expanding the opportunities available to displaced people. We thank you for registering with us and sharing your skills to help us open this new legal pathway and prove that people who have been displaced to another country can and should be considered for international employment opportunities. </p>
   
      <p>We share frequent updates of our progress to open this new pathway to our various media channels and will also email these updates to registrants who have provided an email.
