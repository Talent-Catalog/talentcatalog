      <p>Dear <span th:text="${displayName}"></span>,</p>
      <p>
         <strong>Thank you for registering on the <a href="https://tctalent.org/">Talent Catalog</a></strong>
      </p>

      <p>Your username is <span th:text="${username}"></span>.<br/>
      If you forget your password, you can reset it <a th:href="${forgotPwdUrl}">here</a>.

      <p>
         For the best chance of attracting an employer’s attention, continue to update your profile
         as you gain additional experience, education, or skills.
      </p>
      <p>
         Be assured that we will not share your contact information with any other party without
         your permission (see our

      <p>
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH_5_vBhiFk">Talent Beyond Boundaries’ mission</a>
         is to help refugees and other forcibly displaced people find safety and security through
         skilled migration.
      </p>

      <p>
         Please keep in mind that - while we want to help everyone -
         <strong>only a very small proportion of people listed in our Talent Catalog will ever be
            offered international employment</strong>.
         Thus you should not completely rely on this solution, and should continue to pursue other
         opportunities if/when they are available to you.
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong>We will only contact you if an employer expresses interest in your profile</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
         If you manage to secure an international job offer
         <em>independently of Talent Beyond Boundaries</em>,
         let us know, as we may be able to assist you with your visa application.
      </p>
