      <p>Dear <span th:text="${displayName}"></span>,</p>
      <p>
         <strong>Thank you for registering on the <a href="https://tctalent.org/">Talent Catalog</a></strong>
      </p>

      <p>
         Your local Talent Catalog partner is
         <span th:text="${partner.getAbbreviation()} + ' ' + ${partner.getWebsiteUrl()}"></span>
      </p>

      <p>
         You can log in again by clicking <a th:href="${loginUrl}">here</a>
         or by going to <span th:text="${loginUrl}"></span> in your browser.
      </p>
      <p>
         Your Talent Catalog username is <span th:text="${username}"></span>.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you forget your password, click on "Forgot password" on the Talent Catalog login screen.
      </p>

      <p>
         For the best chance of attracting an employer’s attention, continue to update your profile
         as you gain additional experience, education, or skills.
      </p>

      <p>
         Please keep in mind that - while we want to help everyone -
         <strong>only a very small proportion of people listed in our Talent Catalog will ever be
            offered international employment</strong>.
         So you should not completely rely on this solution, and should continue to pursue other
         opportunities if/when they are available to you.
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong>We will only contact you if an employer expresses interest in your profile</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
         If you manage to secure an international job offer
         <em>independently of <span th:text="${partner.getAbbreviation()}"></span></em>,
         let us know, as we may be able to assist you with your visa application.
      </p>


      <p><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong></p>

      <p>
         Your contact information will not be shared with any other party without your permission.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <p>
         Please do not share your username or password.
      </p>
      <p>
         Partners using the Talent Catalog will never ask you for any form of payment for
         registering or to receive a job offer. We do not charge any money for our services.
         If anyone asks you for money, that is a scam.
         You should ignore the request and notify <span th:text="${partner.getAbbreviation()}"></span> immediately.
      <p>
         Please contact your local partner, <span th:text="${partner.getAbbreviation()}"></span>,
         if you would like to delete your profile.
      </p>
