/**
 * Service for managing Google reCaptcha validation.
 * Used to prevent credential stuffing attacks.
 * Automated data entry - eg for registration will be ignored.
 * <p>
 *     Based on https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-registration-captcha
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     reCaptcha - see https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/
 *     Talent Catalog is currently managed out of Google account john@cameronfoundation.org,
 *     with jcameron@talentbeyondboundaries.org as a notifiable email.
 *     The one reCaptcha can serve multiple domains associated with the same site - eg
 *     tctalent.org, unhcrtalent.org, iomtalent.org, localhost, 127.0.0.1 etc.
 *     Note that subdomains do not need extra configuration - you just need to configure the
 *     domain. So the fact that displacedtalent.org is currently configured in reCaptcha means that
 *     any subdomain of that doesn't require any extra configuration - eg tbb.displacedtalent.org,
 *     unhcr.displacedtalent.org etc
