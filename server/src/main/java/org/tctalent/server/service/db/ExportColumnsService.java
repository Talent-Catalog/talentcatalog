 * Unfortunately we have to manually remove export columns. We can't rely on

 * See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2011519/jpa-onetomany-not-deleting-child">...</a>
 * <p/>
 * Note from above reference that JPA 2 supports a solution around "optional=false" and
 * "orphanRemoval"
 * but not sure how well that will work given that ExportColumns table is used for both saved lists
 * and saved searches - so those ids are optional (if saved search export columns are being
 * specified, then savedSearchId will be specified but savedListId won't).
 * Simpler and more straightforward to delete the export columns explicitly by SavedList id.
 * <p/>
 * So before each setExportColumns call, you should use this service to clearExportColumns for
 * that SavedList.
