/**
 * Values can come from one of three sources:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The field of a candidate object</li>
 *   <li>A constant value</li>
 *   <li>The name of a candidate property</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * It has to be one or other - it cannot be more than one. If the field name is not null, that is what is
 * used, otherwise the constant is used.
 * <p/>
 * Note that this could be better designed in Java with a value source interface with two
 * implementations: one a field source and the other a constant source. Unfortunately that
 * does not map to JSON well - which we need to in order to map to send up to Angular Typescript.
