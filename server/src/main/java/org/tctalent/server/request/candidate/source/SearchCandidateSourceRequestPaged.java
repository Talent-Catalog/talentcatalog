 * true or false
 * <p/>
 * The logic for searching depends on whether watched is specified.
 *
 * If watched is specified and is true, all watched sources (by the user) are returned.
 *
 * Otherwise, sources are returned which match the following logic:
 *
 * keyword matches
 * AND
 * fixed (if defined)
 * AND
 * (global OR shared OR owned) - for those values that are defined
