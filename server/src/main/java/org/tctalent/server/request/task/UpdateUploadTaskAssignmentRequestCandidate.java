/**
 * Request to update an Upload TaskAssignment received through the candidate portal
 * <p/>
 * The main difference from other Update TaskAssignmentRequests is that "complete" is not set here.
 * When a user requests an upload they don't know whether it will succeed or not. If it does
 * not succeed, it should not be marked as complete.
 *
 * For the above reason, there is a special completeUploadTask server call to set the complete
 * status. See {@link TaskAssignmentPortalApi#completeUploadTask}
