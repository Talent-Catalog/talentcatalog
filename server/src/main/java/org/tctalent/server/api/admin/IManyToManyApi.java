/**
 * <h1>Many to Many Association API</h1>
 * Definition of standard web API controller methods for a Many to Many
 * table.
 * <p/>
 * A many to many table just contains relationships between two other tables,
 * each of which will have its own Web API for creating, updating and deleting
 * records.
 * The API for this kind of table will just do searches and add and remove
 * relationships.
 * <p/>
 * One side of the many to many relationship can be considered the "master" -
 * and that will be the first named in the API name.
 * For example, related to the many to many relationship defined by the joining
 * table candidate_saved_list, there could be two APIs:
 * CandidateSavedListAPI, where the Candidate would be considered as the
 * "master", and
 * SavedListCandidateAPI, where the SavedList would be considered as the master.
 * <p/>
 * "masterId" refers to the id of a record in the master table.
 * <p/>
 * "slaveId" refers to the other table in the many to many relationship.
 * <p/>
