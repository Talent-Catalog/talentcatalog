 * This is used to store the many-to-many relation between partners and jobs.

 * <p/>
 * Note on the naming convention:
 * <p/>
 * If this was named PartnerJob, it would be storing job information linked to a partner
 * - like CandidateAttachment stores information about an attachment linked to a candidate.
 * The "Relation" part of the name PartnerJobRelation indicates that the entity represents

 * relationship.
