/**
 * This represents an Employer Job Opportunity.
 * <p/>
 * They are backed by equivalent Employer Job Opportunity objects on Salesforce.
 * <p/>
 * Job Opps are intended to only be used for the monitoring open job opps.
 * They are not intended to completely duplicate what is on SF - eg history
 * <p/>
 * Approach to keeping in sync with Salesforce
 * ===========================================
 * - Only job opps that have been registered in TC are updated from Salesforce. There will be
 * opportunities on Salesforce that are not reflected on the TC.
 * - Once a day local open opportunities on the TC are updated from Salesforce
 * (see JobService.updateOpenJobs)
