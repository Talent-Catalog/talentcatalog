/**
 * Records internet requests which have no path but do contain a query or are a subdomain - ie
 * hits on our "root" domain name.
 * <p/>
 * These simple hits on our tctalent.org server will normally be referrals from Google searches,
 * or links from posts we have made on Facebook, Twitter or blogs - or maybe links we have sent
 * out in emails.
 * <p/>
 * The purpose of the RootRequest is to record any query parameters that were appended to these
 * links for the purposes of tracking their origins.
 * In particular, parameters identifying the partner associated with the referral,
 * as well as standard UTM parameters.
 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters
