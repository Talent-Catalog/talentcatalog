/**
 * This indicates whether a candidate who turns up in a saved search really belongs in that search.
 * <p/>
 * For example a candidate may have recorded in his profile that their favourite film is the
 * "The Fabulous Baker Boys". That could mean that the candidate will appear in the
 * saved search for bakers! You could just modify the candidate's profile to remove that movie
 * preference - but you may not want to do that. Another way is to note that the candidate does
 * not really belong in the "Baker" saved search. You can do that by creating one of these objects
 * - setting the reviewStatus to {@link ReviewStatus#rejected}. Then the candidate will no longer
 * appear in the search (unless you explicitly ask to see candidates rejected from the search).
