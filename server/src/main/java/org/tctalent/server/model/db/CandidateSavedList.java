/**
 * A candidate can appear in multiple saved lists.
 * Similarly a saved list contains multiple candidates.
 * This entity represents this Many to Many relationship between Candidates and
 * SavedLists.
 * Each entity record  records the fact that a candidate is associated with a
 * saved list.
 * <p/>
 * It is expressed as an entity so that it can have its own attributes
 * namely {@link #contextNote}.

 * <p/>
 * Note that it is not explicitly stated in the above links (although it is
 * coded in the GitHub source of the Baeldung example) but this object
 * should also have equals and hashCode implementations which are
