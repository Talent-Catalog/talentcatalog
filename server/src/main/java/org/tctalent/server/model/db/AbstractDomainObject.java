       Unfortunate side effect is that it generates "Duplicate generator name seq_gen" warnings
       for each entity at start up.
       Hibernate has a JPA_ID_GENERATOR_GLOBAL_SCOPE_COMPLIANCE setting which can be set false
       but haven't figured out how to set this yet.

      The key problem is that entity objects only get an id once they are
      persisted. If you are using those objects before persisting them
      the absence of an id can lead to peculiar results - for example all
      object instances looking like they are equal.
