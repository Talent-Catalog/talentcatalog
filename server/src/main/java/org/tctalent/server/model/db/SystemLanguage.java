/**
 * These are the various languages that are supported by the candidate portal (front end).
 * <p/>
 * Adding a new language:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         Use tool like Phrase to generate translations. Export file as Nested JSON
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Upload JSON file to Amazon S3 named as [two character language code].json
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Add new entity (table entry) for the new language to this table.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         On the front end Angular code for candidate-portal update the isSelectedLanguageRtl
 *         method in the LanguageService - depending on whether or not the language is right to left.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Add new translations for the various drop downs (eg Countries) in the back end Settings.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
