/**
 * Represents a Salesforce Opportunity.
 * <p/>
 * This is created from incoming JSON in the body of the response to a HTTP GET request for
 * opportunity details.
 * The problem with Salesforce fields is that they all start with upper case - so "Name" rather
 * than "name". This doesn't map well to Java bean objects where field values by convention start
 * with lower case.
 * <p/>
 * If you just code this as a standard Java Bean with private fields accessed by standard
 * getter and setters, the Salesforce JSON won't map to corresponding fields in the Java object
 * because "Name" does not map to "name".
 * <p/>
 * Therefore, the Java properties are each annotated with the @JsonSetter annotation which provides
 * a convenient mapping from the SalesForce field names to standard Java field names.
 * <p/>
 * NOTE: The getters (added here automatically by Lombok) mean that utilities that process this
 * object as a normal bean, will see a normal (lower case) "name" attribute on the bean because
 * that is what they expect to be returned by a getName method.
 * The DtoBuilder is one such utility. In fact it won't find an attribute "Name"!
